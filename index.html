        <br> Benefits Of Partner Yoga It may feel awkward and/or risky, but there are benefits to partner yoga. You can do new,
        unusual poses with your body because of the help, and it feels pretty good to go beyond old limits. In addition,
        giving and receiving help tends to bring people closer together. No matter who your partner is, you will become closer
        with them after practicing partner poses together. You will learn to try new things and trust others with your physical
        body and your emotions/heart.

        <br> Kids yoga is great fun. Children remain actively engaged in movement through imaginative stories and interactions
        with one another. Traditional poses, such as downward facing dog, tree and cat/cow, are taught in creative ways so
        children gain the benefits of yoga while having fun playing.

        Benefits of Yoga For Seniors As we get older, muscles tend to stiffen, our joints lose their range of motion and we become
        more susceptible to chronic problems such as osteoporosis, arthritis and heart disease. Yoga can help slow down the
        effects of the ageing process by maintaining muscle softness and flexibility, keeping the mind alert and awake, encouraging
        relaxation and strengthening muscles and joints. Its multi-pronged approach can encourage the body, mind and spirit
        to remain healthy and strong while reducing the effects of many age-related issues.
